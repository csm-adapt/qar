qar
===

A not-so-basic library of tools for extracting and applying knowledge
present in the fit of a neural network to an expression that captures
the relationship between input, in the space defined by data and
measurements, and output, defined by targets or labels.


Description
===========

Original named for the Queen Anne's Revenge (for convoluted and comical
reasons too silly to mention), QAR, which is an acronym for Question-Answer
Relationship, turns out to be a perfectly serendipitous description of the
goal and purpose of this library.

Though developed under the auspices of a scientific project, the utility
of this library extends beyond the hard sciences into any problem where
a question can be asked of data and an answer returned.


Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.0.3. For details and usage
