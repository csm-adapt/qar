\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In the main, a disconnect exists between physically-based equations that describe observations of complex phenomena and models derived from machine learning methods, including neural networks. This disconnect results in misunderstandings (at a minimum) and philosophical gulfs (worse) between the data scientists and those scientists deeply rooted in disciplines which traditionally study the various complex phenomena.  On the one hand, many academics and scientists have called machine learning, data analytics, and neural networks "black boxes", implying that they are either not understood or that they are simply another, perhaps crude, tool.  On the other hand, there are those
