\section{Abstract}\label{Abstract}

While it is possible to extract equations from various machine learning strategies such as artificial neural networks that relate the independent variables (inputs) to a dependent variable (output), these equations do not naturally reflect known physical phenomena. Here, we present a general approach to learn and produce natural (and perhaps well-known) constitutive relationships (physical laws) from neural networks. The approach is presented in this paper as a comparison of mathematical series expansions of the optimized formula from neural networks and a learned/optimized physical relationship, whether or not known a priori.
% Only certain types of expansions permit convergence to solutions; a gap that must be addressed.
This linkage between the powerful infrastructure of neural networks and the fundamental physical phenomena and laws has many implications that will be introduced. General expansions for many physical phenomena are presented.
